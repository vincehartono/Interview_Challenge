## Part 1 (EDA)

I was given a task to clean up and do Exploratory Data Analysis from a file named logins.json. The file consists of login timestamp with 93,142 rows of data.

The login time ranges from January 1st, 1970 to April 13, 1970. I was stasked to group these login times by 15-minutes interval.

First step I did is to check if there is any missing values in the data and check the types of the input. There are no missing values and the input is in datetime64 data type.

### Group by Date

### Group by Day of Week

### Group by Hour
